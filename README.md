# GotM
## Game of the Month Social Server for Friends who Game Together (and Stay Together)
GotM is an web application for friends to gather and discuss a game that they all vote on each month. Think book of the month, but for games! GotM will include a full suite of features that include but are not limited too voting on games/reviewing games, pulling information from your steam wishlist utilizing the steam API,
and other social aspects like sharing, upvoting, and commenting on clips. The project will utilize a spring backend with an Angular.js front end under a MVC arhitecture and clean solid programming principles.

This project is extremely early on in its development, but at the bottom of this readme or within the repositories files, you will find preliminary design and requirements documents. I am updated those as I make them and the project shifts and changes.

It is my goal to create a product that will help even those with little knowledge of software development the ability to run and host their own "digital time capsule" on common hardware. Open-source contribution is greatly encouraged.
